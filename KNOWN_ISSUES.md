# Known Issues (v1.0.0)

Despite reaching v1.0.0, the following security and usability issues are known and scheduled for future resolution.

## Security Issues

### 1. HKDF Zeroization (36-3) — Blocked
The `hkdf` crate (v0.12 / v0.13) does **not** expose a `zeroize` feature, so internal HMAC context and PRK are not auto-zeroized on drop.
- **Status**: **Blocked** by upstream ecosystem. The `hmac` crate added `zeroize` in v0.13, but `hkdf` does not propagate it. Forcing `hkdf` v0.13 also pulls in `digest` v0.11, which conflicts with the `digest` v0.10-locked majority of our crypto stack (`p256`, `ecdsa`, `aes-gcm`, `sha3`).
- **Mitigation**: Output keys produced from HKDF are already wrapped in `Zeroizing` at call sites (`src/strategy/`, `src/backend/`). Only the crate-internal intermediate state remains potentially residual.
- **Risk**: Low (intermediate KDF states might remain in memory briefly).
- **Root Fix**: Wait for the RustCrypto ecosystem to migrate to `digest` v0.11 across `p256` / `aes-gcm` / `sha3`, then upgrade in lockstep with `hkdf` zeroize-aware revisions. Re-evaluate then.
- **Investigation reference**: `THREAT_36-3_INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md`.

### 2. ML-KEM Seed Internal Copy (37-2)
The underlying `fips203` library may perform internal copies of sensitive seeds that are outside the control of `nkCryptoTool`.
- **Status**: Blocked by upstream library updates.

## Usability Issues

### 1. Stdin/Stdout only File Transfer
Iroh file transfer currently only supports redirection via stdin/stdout. Direct file path arguments for network transfer are not yet implemented.

## GUI Features (deferred)

### 1. QR Code Scan (M2)
Automatic NKCT1 ticket reading via camera is not yet implemented.
- **Workaround**: Manual copy-paste of connection tickets.

### 2. Desktop Notifications (M4)
Background message notifications are not yet implemented.

### 3. Screen Capture Protection (M5)
Explicit window capture exclusion for sensitive fields is not yet implemented.
